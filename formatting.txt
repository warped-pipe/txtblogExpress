TXT Blog Post Formatting Guide
============================

1. Metadata Format
-----------------
The first few lines of your post must contain metadata in this exact format:

Title: Your Post Title
Author: yourname
Date: YYYY/MM/DD
Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
Image: /images/posts/post-1.jpg

2. Text Formatting
-----------------
- Use double line breaks (\n\n) to separate paragraphs
- Single line breaks (\n) will be treated as line breaks within a paragraph
- Use *text* for italic text
- Use **text** for bold text

Example:
This is the first paragraph with *italic* and **bold** text.

This is the second paragraph.
This line is part of the second paragraph.

3. Headers
---------
- Use ## followed by a space for section headers
- Headers should be on their own line

Example:
## Section Title

4. Lists
--------
- Use - followed by a space for bullet points
- Each list item should be on its own line
- Lists should be separated from other content by double line breaks
- List items can contain *italic*, **bold**, [links](url), and ![images](url)

Example:
Here's a list of items:

- First *item* with **emphasis**
- Second item with a [link](https://example.com)
- Third item with an ![image](/images/example.jpg)

5. Code Blocks
-------------
- Use triple backticks (```) to start and end code blocks
- Code blocks should be on their own lines
- Separate code blocks from other content with double line breaks

Example:
Here's some code:

```
function hello() {
    console.log('Hello World');
}
```

6. Links and Images
------------------
- Use [text](url) for links
- Use ![alt text](url) for inline images
- URLs can be relative (starting with /) or absolute (starting with http:// or https://)

Example:
Check out this [link to Google](https://google.com) and this ![example image](/images/example.jpg).

7. Special Notes
---------------
- Always use double line breaks to separate different types of content
- Keep your formatting consistent throughout the post
- Make sure there are no extra spaces at the end of lines
- Use proper indentation for code blocks and lists
- Inline formatting (*, **, [], ![]) can be used within paragraphs, lists, and headers
