I had previously been using classicpress for blogging, but was unhappy with it and felt that what I needed was something much more lightweight, preferably static, and I wanted to be able to write in .txt files using markdown -- as I would normally for writing long-form notes or documentation.

So, I set out to make something that would make it easier for me to share my projects by allowing me to throw the .txt files that I'm writing anyway into a directory and have them automatically converted to HTML, an RSS feed, and a sitemap -- while also not sacrificing style and layout.

I probably could have used Hugo or something, but where is the fun in that? Plus, now I have something to build on. Who knows what it'll be in a few years?
