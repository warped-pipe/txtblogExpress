Today we're creating a simple blog system using Node.js, Express, and plain text files for content.

Instead of using a database, we're storing each post as a pair of files:
1. A JSON file containing metadata (title, author, date, tags)
2. A TXT file containing the actual content of the post

This approach is simple yet powerful for small sites and personal blogs. It makes content management straightforward - just add new files to the posts directory!

## Benefits of This Approach

- No database setup required
- Easy version control with Git
- Simple to back up
- Markdown support can be easily added
- Content can be edited with any text editor

In the next post, we'll look at adding an admin interface for creating and editing posts without directly editing files.
