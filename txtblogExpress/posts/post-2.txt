Express.js is one of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.

Express makes it easy to create routes, handle requests, and manage middleware. In this post, we'll look at how to set up a basic Express server and handle different types of requests.

## Basic Express Server

Setting up an Express server is straightforward. First, install Express:

```
npm install express
```

Then create a simple server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
